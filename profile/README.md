## A Hockey Analytics Project

Pucksmart is the home for my hockey analytics exploration. Initially I will be exploring the feasibility of a couple different Elo-like rating systems, one for players, and one for faceoff takers.

I'm currently in the data engineering stage, I am gathering the required information from the public sources available through the NHL.com website.

Eventually my work will be available to browse at https://pucksmart.net
